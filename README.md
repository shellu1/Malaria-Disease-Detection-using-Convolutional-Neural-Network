Malaria Disease Detection using Convolutional Neural Network

Introduction: Malaria, a life-threatening disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, spreads to people through the bites of some infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. This project focuses on the development of a deep learning model for the classification of malaria parasitized and uninfected cell images.

Objective: The goal of this project is to create a CNN model capable of distinguishing between two key classes:

Parasitized Cells: Red blood cells infected with Plasmodium parasites. Uninfected Cells: Healthy red blood cells without malaria infection.

Significance : Automated malaria cell classification has the potential to speed up the diagnostic process, especially in regions with limited access to healthcare resources. The successful implementation of this model could contribute to more efficient and accurate malaria diagnosis, aiding healthcare professionals in providing timely and targeted interventions.
